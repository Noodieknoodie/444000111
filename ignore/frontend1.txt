# 401k App Payments Page Detailed Specification

## I. Navigation & Interface Framework

### Primary Navigation
At the top of the screen lies a sleek navigation bar housing the distinctive "HWM" logo nestled in the corner. A series of elegant tabs stretches across this bar, providing access to different sections of the application: Payments (currently active), Quarterly Summary, Manage Clients, and Export. The active tab distinguishes itself with a subtle yet noticeable underline indicator that feels intentional rather than merely decorative. This navigation system conveys authority while maintaining an airy, unimposing presence.

### Client Sidebar
The left side of the interface features a refined sidebar dedicated to client selection. This sidebar offers two distinct viewing modes. In Client View, users see a straightforward alphabetical list of all clients, each represented by a circular avatar containing their initials followed by their full name. For example, "Acme Corporation" would appear with an "AC" avatar, while "Bedrock Industries" would show "BI." The currently selected client is visually distinguished from others in the list, creating an immediate sense of context.

The alternative Provider View organizes clients hierarchically under their respective providers. For instance, clients like "Acme Corporation" and "Bedrock Industries" might be nested under "John Hancock," while others appear under "Fidelity Investments" or "Vanguard Group." Each provider entry displays the number of associated clients in parentheses and features expand/collapse controls to manage the display of nested clients. This organization dramatically improves navigation efficiency for users who typically work with clients from specific providers.

A search field crowns the sidebar, offering real-time filtering of the client list as users type. This intelligent search functionality responds instantly, narrowing down options and making client location effortless even within extensive client rosters.

## II. Client Information Display

### Client Header
When a client is selected, their information takes center stage at the top of the main content area. The client's name appears in a confident, substantial typography that establishes its importance in the hierarchy. Below this, their full address displays in a more subdued style, followed by a "Client since" date that provides valuable context about the relationship longevity. For example, "Cyberdyne Systems" might appear prominently, followed by "5000 Terminator Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90001" and "Client since March 2019" in progressively lighter visual treatments.

### Client Details
The client details section presents essential contract information in a highly scannable format divided into three logical groupings. The Provider Information group includes details such as the provider name (e.g., "John Hancock"), contract number (e.g., "JH-2019-4586"), client since date (e.g., "Mar 05, 2019"), and participant count (e.g., "238 participants").

The Payment Details group displays the payment schedule (showing whether the client pays "Monthly" or "Quarterly"), the fee structure (indicating if it's "Percentage-based" or a "Flat Rate"), and the applicable rate information. For percentage-based clients, this would show both the annual rate (e.g., "0.75% annually") and its periodic equivalent (e.g., "$0.1875% quarterly").

The Current Status group provides an immediate visual indicator of the client's payment status for the current period, clearly marked as "PAID," "PENDING," or "OVERDUE" with the corresponding due date and payment date if applicable. For instance, "STATUS: PAID" might be followed by "Q1 2023," "Due: Mar 31, 2023," and "Paid: Mar 15, 2023."

### Latest Payment Summary
The most recent payment information receives special attention, appearing in a distinct section that emphasizes critical metrics. This summary includes the payment date (e.g., "Mar 15, 2023"), the period covered (e.g., "Q1 2023"), and the Assets Under Management or AUM value (e.g., "$18,756,423.00"). The expected fee calculation appears prominently (e.g., "$35,168.29"), alongside the actual amount received (e.g., "$35,200.00") and the resulting variance expressed both as an absolute value and a percentage (e.g., "+$31.71 (+0.09%)"). The payment method (e.g., "ACH Transfer") rounds out this comprehensive overview.

### Client Contacts
Contact information is thoughtfully organized in a tab-based structure that separates contacts into logical categories: Primary Contacts, Authorized Contacts, and Provider Contacts. Each contact entry displays the individual's name prominently, followed by their contact details including mobile phone, office phone, and email address arranged in an easily scannable format. For example, under Primary Contacts, one might see entries for "Miles Dyson" and "Sarah Connor," each with their complete contact information clearly presented.

## III. Payment Management

### Add Payment Form
The form for adding new payments embodies clarity and intelligence, guiding users through the payment entry process with precision. The Received Date field uses a calendar selector for intuitive date input (e.g., "03/15/2023"). Adjacent to this, a thoughtful toggle allows users to specify whether the payment applies to a Single Period or spans multiple periods (Split Period).

The Applied Period selection adapts intelligently based on the period toggle. For a single period, a simple dropdown lets users select the relevant quarter or month (e.g., "Q1 2023"). When Split Period is selected, a second dropdown appears, enabling users to select both start and end periods (e.g., "Q1 2023 to Q2 2023"). This elegant solution handles the complexity of split payments without cluttering the interface.

The Amount Received field accepts currency input with automatic formatting (e.g., "$35,200.00"). Below this, the optional Assets Under Management field enables users to enter the total managed assets value (e.g., "$18,756,423.00"), which drives automatic fee calculations.

The Payment Method field offers a dropdown with common options like ACH Transfer, Direct Deposit, Check, and Invoice, with an "Other" option that enables custom text entry when selected. This approach balances standardization with flexibility.

Perhaps most impressively, the form features dynamic calculation of the Expected Fee based on the client's fee structure and the entered AUM. For percentage-based clients, entering an AUM value immediately updates the expected fee (e.g., "$35,168.29"). The system then automatically computes the variance between expected and received amounts, displaying both the dollar difference and percentage (e.g., "+$31.71 (+0.09%)"). This real-time feedback helps users identify and address discrepancies before submission.

Clear and Submit buttons appear at the bottom of the form, with the primary action (Submit) given appropriate visual emphasis to guide user behavior.

### Payment History Table
The payment history presents a comprehensive record of past transactions in a sophisticated table format. Users can filter this history by year using a dropdown selector that defaults to the current year but allows viewing all years when needed.

Each row in this history represents a single payment transaction with columns displaying the payment date (e.g., "Mar 15, 2023"), the period covered (e.g., "Q1 2023" or "Q1-Q2 2023" for split payments), the AUM value (e.g., "$18,756,423.00"), the expected fee (e.g., "$35,168.29"), the actual amount received (e.g., "$35,200.00"), and the resulting variance (e.g., "+$31.71").

For split period payments, the period column clearly indicates both the start and end periods, such as "Q1-Q2 2023," making it immediately apparent which payments span multiple periods. This visual distinction helps users quickly identify different payment types within the history.

The action column provides functionality through a series of intuitive icons: a document icon for viewing attached documentation (only visible when documents exist), an edit icon for modifying payment details, and a delete icon for removing erroneous entries. These controls align with the overall minimalist aesthetic while providing comprehensive functionality.

Pagination controls beneath the table maintain performance with large datasets while giving users control over their viewing experience.

### Edit Payment Mode
When a user selects the edit icon for an existing payment, the Add Payment form transforms subtly to indicate the different mode of operation. The form pre-populates with all existing payment data, allowing the user to make precise modifications. The form's title changes to "Edit Payment" with the payment ID for context, and the action buttons transform to "Cancel" and "Save Changes" to reflect the current operation.

This modal includes all the same fields and dynamic calculations as the Add Payment form, ensuring consistency across interactions while clearly communicating the current editing context.

### Delete Payment Flow
The delete operation initiates a thoughtful confirmation dialog that prevents accidental data loss. This dialog clearly identifies the payment being deleted, showing the amount, date, and period information to prevent user error. The confirmation requires deliberate action, with the cancel option being the default focus to avoid accidental confirmations.

Upon successful deletion, a subtle notification confirms the action completion, providing reassurance without disrupting the user's workflow.

## IV. Document Preview Mode

### Split Screen Layout
When a user clicks the document view icon in the payment history, the interface transforms into a sophisticated split-screen layout. The main content area contracts to occupy 60% of the viewport, while a document preview panel smoothly slides in to occupy the remaining 40%.

The document preview panel displays PDFs with high fidelity, featuring intuitive zoom controls and a prominent close button. This panel might show a scanned check, payment confirmation, or other documentation related to the selected payment.

The main content area doesn't merely shrink—it intelligently adapts by showing a condensed view of the most relevant payment information. This includes key details like payment date, amount, period covered, and variance information. The corresponding payment history entry receives subtle highlighting to maintain context.

Non-essential elements temporarily hide to maintain focus on the comparison between payment details and documentation. Smooth transition animations create a sense of spatial relationship as the interface shifts between states, preserving user context and enhancing understanding.

When the user closes the document preview, the interface gracefully returns to its original state with a satisfying animation that reinforces the spatial model of the interface.

## V. Interaction Nuances

### Form Interactions
Form fields respond to focus with subtle but noticeable state changes that guide the user through the input process. Dropdowns expand with smooth animations that feel substantial without being sluggish. Calendar selectors appear with a gentle entrance effect and provide a clear date selection experience.

Error states communicate clearly when user input requires correction, with helpful guidance on resolving issues. Currency inputs automatically format values as users type, adding thousands separators and decimal places without requiring manual formatting.

The dynamic calculation of expected fees and variances updates with a subtle animation that draws attention to the change without becoming distracting.

### Table Interactions
The payment history table responds to user interaction with refined hover states that highlight the entire row, creating a sense of direct manipulation. Sorting indicators appear subtle but clear when a column is used for sorting.

The document, edit, and delete icons develop a slight emphasis on hover, inviting interaction without demanding attention when not in focus.

### Navigation Transitions
Transitions between different clients create a sense of movement that helps users maintain context. The selected client in the sidebar and the displayed client information change in a coordinated animation that reinforces their relationship.

When switching between Client and Provider views in the sidebar, a thoughtful transition helps users understand the organizational change, with elements sliding into their new positions rather than abruptly jumping.

## VI. Emotional Design Aspects

The entire payments page experience should evoke a sense of precision and confidence. Users should feel that the system understands the complexity of payment management and has distilled it to its essential elements.

The interface should communicate trustworthiness through its visual stability and predictable behaviors. Every interaction should feel deliberate and purposeful rather than arbitrary or decorative.

Most importantly, the design should create a sense of calm competence—users should feel that they are working with a sophisticated tool that respects their intelligence and streamlines their workflow in meaningful ways.


Examples of Page Elements with Sample Data
To better illustrate how the interface elements would look in practice, here are detailed descriptions of key components with realistic data:
Client Information Example
Imagine looking at the client page for "Cyberdyne Systems." At the top of the page, their name appears in bold, confident typography with a subtle gradient underline that adds sophistication without being flashy. Below this, you'd see their complete address "5000 Terminator Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90001" and the contextual note "Client since March 2019."
The client details section would show that they're contracted with "John Hancock" under contract number "JH-2019-4586" since March 5, 2019, with 238 participants currently enrolled. Their payment schedule would indicate "Quarterly" with a percentage-based fee structure at "0.75% annually" (equating to "0.1875% quarterly"). The current status would show "PAID" for Q1 2023, with the information that it was due on March 31, 2023, but paid early on March 15, 2023.
Payment History with Split Payments
In the payment history table, most entries would show standard quarterly payments, but some would clearly indicate split periods. For example, you might see a standard entry showing "Mar 15, 2023" for period "Q1 2023" with an AUM of "$18,756,423.00", an expected fee of "$35,168.29", and an actual payment of "$35,200.00".
In contrast, a split payment might appear as "Jun 30, 2022" for period "Q2-Q3 2022" with an AUM of "$18,245,630.00", an expected fee of "$68,421.11" (representing two quarters' worth of fees), and an actual payment of "$68,400.00". The variance would show as "-$21.11 (-0.03%)". This visual distinction makes it immediately apparent which payments cover multiple periods, enabling better tracking and reconciliation.
Document Preview Experience
When viewing a document for a payment, the screen would transform elegantly. Imagine selecting the document icon for the March 15, 2023 payment. The main interface would gracefully contract to the left side of the screen, showing a focused view of just the essential payment details: the date (March 15, 2023), amount ($35,200.00), period (Q1 2023), expected fee ($35,168.29), and variance (+$31.71).
Simultaneously, a document panel would slide in from the right, displaying a high-resolution image of the payment check or ACH confirmation. You'd see the check number, payment amount, date, and payee information clearly visible in the document. Zoom controls would allow detailed inspection of specific portions of the document, while maintaining the context of the payment details on the left for easy comparison and verification.
Adding a Split Period Payment
When adding a new payment that spans multiple periods, the form adapts intelligently. After entering the received date (e.g., "06/30/2022") and selecting the "Split Period" option, two period selectors would appear side by side. You could select "Q2 2022" in the first dropdown and "Q3 2022" in the second.
After entering the amount received ($68,400.00) and the AUM ($18,245,630.00), the system would automatically calculate the expected fee based on two quarters at the client's percentage rate, showing "$68,421.11" as the expected amount. The variance would automatically calculate as "-$21.11 (-0.03%)" – a slight underpayment.
The payment method dropdown would show common options like "ACH Transfer," "Direct Deposit," "Check," "Invoice," and "Other." If "Other" were selected, a text field would appear, allowing entry of custom payment methods like "Wire Transfer" or "Credit Card."
This approach to wireframe specification balances aesthetic vision with practical detail, providing a clear roadmap for implementation while maintaining focus on the sophisticated, purposeful elegance that defines the desired user experience.
