# State Management Best Practices

1. CENTRALIZATION: Maintain a single source of truth for application-wide state.

2. GRANULARITY: Split state into logical domains rather than one massive state object.

3. IMMUTABILITY: Always update state immutably, never modify state objects directly.

4. ACTION PATTERNS: Use consistent patterns for state changes (actions, reducers, etc.) depending on your library.

5. SELECTORS: Create selector functions to access derived state rather than calculating derived data in components.

6. LOCAL VS. GLOBAL: Keep state as local as possible. Only elevate to global state when truly needed by multiple components.

7. PERSISTENCE: Implement clear strategies for state persistence (local storage, cookies) when needed.

8. CACHING: Define explicit caching and invalidation strategies for remote data.
